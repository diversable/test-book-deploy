# The Leptos Community and `leptos-*` Crates

## The Community

One final note before we get to building with Leptos: if you haven't already, feel free to join the growing community on the Leptos [Discord](https://discord.gg/YdRAhS7eQB) and on [Github](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos). Our Discord channel in particular is very active and friendly - we'd love to have you there!

```admonish note
If you find a chapter or an explanation that isn't clear while you're working your way through the Leptos book, just mention it in the "docs-and-education" channel or ask a question in "help" so we can clear things up and update the book for others.
```

As you get further along in your Leptos journey and find that you have questions about "how to do 'x' with Leptos", then search the Discord "help" channel to see if a similar question has been asked before, or feel free to post your own question - the community is quite helpful and very responsive.

The "[Discussions](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/discussions)" on Github are also a great place for asking questions and keeping up with Leptos announcements.

And of course, if you run into any bugs while developing with Leptos or would like to make a feature request (or contribute a bug fix / new feature), open up an issue on the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/issues).


## Leptos-* Crates

The community has built a growing number of Leptos-related crates that will help you get productive with Leptos projects more quickly - check out the list of crates built on top of Leptos and contributed by the community on the [Awesome Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/awesome-leptos) repo on Github.

If you want to find the newest, up-and-coming Leptos-related crates, check out the "Tools and Libraries" section of the Leptos Discord. In that section, there are channels for the Leptos `view!` macro formatter (in the "leptosfmt" channel); there's a channel for the utility library "leptos-use"; another channel for the UI component libary "leptonic";  and a "libraries" channel where new `leptos-*` crates are discussed before making their way into the growing list of crates and resources available on [Awesome Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/awesome-leptos).
