# Part 1: Building User Interfaces

In the first part of the book, we're going to look at building user interfaces on the client-side using Leptos. Under the hood, Leptos and Trunk are bundling up a snippet of Javascript which will load up the Leptos UI, which has been compiled to WebAssembly to drive the interactivity in your CSR (client-side rendered) website.

Part 1 will introduce you to the basic tools you need to build a reactive user interface powered by Leptos and Rust. By the end of Part 1, you should be able to
build a snappy synchronous website that's rendered in the browser and which you can deploy on any static-site hosting service, like Github Pages or Vercel.
